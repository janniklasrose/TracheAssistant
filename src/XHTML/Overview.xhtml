        <p>
            Welcome to <i>TracheAssistant</i>, the STAR-CCM+ Simulation Assistant for airway CFD simulations in human tracheas.
            This assistant will (attempt to) guide you through the typical setup for airway simulations.
            Keep an eye on the Output window for console messages.

                <li>
                    Consider creating a HTML summary report with each simulation file for simple parsing of settings and as reference later on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If in doubt, consult the official help by pressing [<b>F1</b>]
